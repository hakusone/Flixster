## Flix Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [x] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
  - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
  - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [x] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [x] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [x] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes


It takes a lot of time testing on "bad internet", because Glide caches images it loads. I ended up having to delete the cache every time I wanted to get a gif.

### Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Androids

## Flix Part 2

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)

- [x] (8pts) Expose details of movie (ratings using RatingBar, popularity, and synopsis) in a separate activity.
- [x] (2pts) Allow video posts to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView.

#### BONUS

- [x] Implement a shared element transition when user clicks into the details of a movie (1 point).
- [x] Trailers for popular movies are played automatically when the movie is selected (1 point).
    - [x] When clicking on a popular movie (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars) the video should be played immediately.
    - [x] Less popular videos rely on the detailed page should show an image preview that can initiate playing a YouTube video.
- [x] Add a play icon overlay to popular movies to indicate that the movie can be played (1 point).
- [x] Apply data binding for views to help remove boilerplate code. (1 point)
- [x] Add a rounded corners for the images using the Glide transformations. (1 point)

### Notes

I couldn't find a lot of recent examples for Android Studio and how it interacts with Youtube API Player. Eventually I found out how to force the video into landscape mode every time and how to instantly play it (using the `loadVideo` instead of `cueVideo` function), but I couldn't find a coherent explanation on how to make a custom fullscreen layout. In any case, the YoutubeVideoPlayer works best if the app was in landscape mode already. Portrait mode expanding into full screen experienced a lot of hiccups. 

Working with the Youtube API Player was a little frustrating. Sometimes, it would suddenly stop working, reporting an initialization error that ended up being "fixed" if I removed the youtube service start query in the manifest, quit the app, put the query back in, and restarted the app. Other times, some videos would be stuck on a perpetually black processing screen and I had to restart the app to try to get it to load, while other videos (the popular videos) actually worked.

A note about Glide Transformations: the most recent version of Glide handles a number of transformations without the need for the additional library. The implementation looks like this:

```
Glide.with(view.getContext())
.load(url)
.placeholder(R.drawable.ic_baseline_movie_24)
.transform(new CenterInside(), new RoundedCorners(20))
.into(view);
```

I initially used the library recommended in the guides but found out it added a lot of unnecessary padding/margins on my image and ended up discovering that the Glide library supported Rounded Corners in a cleaner way.

I really liked data binding and implemented it to some degree to cut down the number of `findViewById` I used, but when it came to trying to do events/listeners data-binding, I couldn't figure out a good way to convert my implementation of the onClick events into handlers I could extract to another file or move to MovieAdapter, because the event needed to be executed in context of the ViewHolders. A lot of the examples I ended up finding weren't RecyclerViews (much less with multiple ViewHolders) or used Kotlin.

### Notes
I made the most popular movies require over 8 stars, because most of the movies were over 5 stars (except for one), and it wouldn't display some of the user stories well.

I had difficulty capturing the placeholder image in action, because the app liked to load all at once. Technically, I did implement it and I did see it sometimes, but not consistently to capture in a gif.

Edit: Tried to make placeholder work. Things I did include: setting different network speeds in the Virtual Device Manager, making configuration a separate get request (instead of hardcoding the url), and attempted to clear Glide's memory and disk cache (but failed). I think Glide's cache'ing images, so it never actually fetches the images from the url.
