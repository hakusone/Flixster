### Notes
I made the most popular movies require over 8 stars, because most of the movies were over 5 stars (except for one), and it wouldn't display some of the user stories well.

I had difficulty capturing the placeholder image in action, because the app liked to load all at once. Technically, I did implement it and I did see it sometimes, but not consistently to capture in a gif.

Edit: Tried to make placeholder work. Things I did include: setting different network speeds in the Virtual Device Manager, making configuration a separate get request (instead of hardcoding the url), and attempted to clear Glide's memory and disk cache (but failed). I think Glide's cache'ing images, so it never actually fetches the images from the url.
